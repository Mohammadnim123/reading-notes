# Chapter 5 “Images”

> If you are building a site from scratch, it is good
practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.

Now to add img to your web site and make style for it we can do that by adding \<img\> and its attribute :


>**src:** This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.

alt:**
This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

>**title:**
You can also use the title
attribute with the \<img\> element
to provide additional information
about the image.

>**height:**
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.

>**width:**
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

>**align:**
The align attribute was
commonly used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should
flow around an image.

**There are Three Rules for Creating Images:**

* Save images in
the right format

* Save images at
the right size

* Use the correct
resolution

>Animated GIFs show several frames of an
image in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

>**\<figure\>:**
Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new \<figure\> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.

>**\<figcaption\>:**
The \<figcaption\> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.

* The \<img\> element is used to add images to a
web page.

* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

* You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.



# Chapter 11 “Color”

> * Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

> * There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

> * Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

> * It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

> * CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

> * CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# Chapter 12 “Text”

> * There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

> * There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.

> * If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.

> * You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

> * You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
