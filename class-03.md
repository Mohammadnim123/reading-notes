# HTML & CSS
## Chapter 3 “Lists”

> * There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.

> * Ordered lists use numbers.

> * Unordered lists use bullets.

> * Definition lists are used to define terminology.

> * Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Chapter 13 “Boxes”

> * CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

> * You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

> * You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.

> * It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.

> * Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

> * Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.

> * CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

some of css command :

define | command
-----------|------------
Box Dimensions | width, height
Limiting Width | min-width, max-width
Limiting hight | min-height, max-height
Overflowing Content | overflow
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another. | Border 
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. | Margin
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents. | Padding
border width | border-width (the same thing for color and style)
short hand | border
change Inline/Block | display: inline; or display: inline-block; or display: block;
Hiding Boxes | visibility
Border Images | border-image: url("")
Box Shad ows | box-shadow
Rounded Corners | border-radius

# JavaScript
## Chapter 4 “Decisions and Loops” 

DATA TYPE | PURPOSE
-----------| ----------
string | Text
number | Number
Boolean | true or false
null | Empty value
undefined | Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value

### LOOPS

Loops : commands can can execute a block of code a number of times and there are two type of it.

![loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/images/for_loop.jpg)

>for - loops through a block of code a number of times

>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

**This is the structure of the for loop :**
![for](https://www.sitesbay.com/cpp/images/control-statement/for-loop-steps.png)

>the for loop will stop if the condition give false.

**And this is the structure for While loop :**

>This loop will continue to run
for as long as the condition in
the parentheses is true.


**now for if statement:**

**now for switch statement:**

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
