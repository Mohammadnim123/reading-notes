# HTML & CSS

## Chapter 4 “Links”


> * Links are created using the \<a\> element.

> * The \<a\> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.

> * If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

> * You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

> * You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

**for Email Links we use it like this:**

\<a href="mailto:jon@example.org"\>Email Jon\</a\>

**for Opening Links in a New Window we use it like this:**

\<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank"\>Internet Movie Database\</a\> (opens in new window)

## Chapter 15 “Layout”

> **Building Blocks :**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

> Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
\<h1\> \<p\> \<ul\> \<li\>.

> Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
\<img\> \<b\> \<i\>

> **Containing Elements:**
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

>**Controlling the Position of Elements :** CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

>**Normal flow:**
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.

>**Relative Positioning:**
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed.

>**Absolute positioning:**
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element.

>To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we
introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.)

>**Fixed Positioning:**
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.

>**Floating Elements:**
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box.

>When you move
any element from
normal flow, boxes
can overlap. The
z-index property
allows you to control
which box appears
on top.

> * \<div\> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

> * Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

> * The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

> * Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

> * Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

> * Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

> * CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

> * You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## FUNCTIONS

>**Functions :** group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.

>**calling:** when you want to ask function to do his task.

>**parameters:** pieces of information passed to function.

>**return value:** the answer when you call the function.

>the functions written like this:
function updateMessage () {}

![func](https://tutorial.techaltum.com/images/javascript-functions.jpg)

>_function declaration:_ is a statement containing a function prototype (function name, return type, the types of parameters and their order).

>_Calling Function:_ excute all of the statments between its curly braces with just one line of code.

sayHello();
## example:
**You can call this function like this :**
![kl](https://i2.wp.com/2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2018/10/02-01-1.png?ssl=1)

by using createUniverse();

# Reasons for Pair Programming

**How does pair programming work?**
* While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

> **_The Driver_:  is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.**

> **_The Navigator_: uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.**

**Now the Reasons for Pair Programming :**

* Greater efficiency.
* Engaged collaboration.
* Learning from fellow students
* Social skills.
* Job interview readiness
* Work environment readiness
