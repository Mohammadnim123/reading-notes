# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming 

> At the first John sonmez use the protin tracker application on his courses trainig because it was so easy to understand, the focus was taken off of the problem domain and put instead on the technology also it served as a reference problem domain that didn’t have to be re-learned.

> by taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, I am able to make both teaching and learning easier.

> Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.

> As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it. Just try and read the famous Domain Driven Design book and you’ll quickly see how complicated and difficult problem domains can be.  (Great book by the way, although you may have to read it twice or three times—I certainly did.)

**Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain**

>If you know the problem domain then writing the code become very easy as so the most important thing to know it.

> If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.

>Also you can sit down and talking to customers or business people who know about the problem domain.

## Chapter 3 “Object Literals”

**_Objects:_** group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

**_Literal notation:_** is the easist and most popular way to create object.

> There are another way called Dot Notation:

ex ---> `var hotelName = hotel.name;`

ex ---> `var hotelName = hotel['name'];`

## Chapter 5 “Document Object Model”

> * The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.

> * DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

> * You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

> * Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.

> * From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

> * An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.

> * In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).

> * Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
